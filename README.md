# cortex

Personal workspace for agent orchestration experiments.

## What This Is

Playground for exploring how AI agents compose, chain, and pass state.

Started from meta-analysis of session-mining/ending-session skills. Found some interesting gaps. Storing work here.

## Current Thread

Working on: agent composition primitives

Questions:
- How should skills chain reliably?
- What's missing for state passing?
- Why do I have 46 skills but only use 2-4?
- Are skills even the right abstraction?

## Structure

```
cortex/
├── research/      # analyses, findings, notes
├── specs/         # if we design anything formal
├── prototypes/    # experiments
├── migrations/    # if we refactor existing stuff
└── meta/          # tools for improving tools
```

## Notes

- Not decided on direction yet
- Could evolve into something, could stay personal
- Name might change
- Focus on the work, not the packaging
