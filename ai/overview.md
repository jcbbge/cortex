# Cortex: AI-Powered Development Assistant

## Overview
Cortex is a terminal-native AI assistant designed to unify fragmented development workflows by integrating natural language interaction, context-aware memory, and direct command execution into a single interface.

### Development Philosophy
- **User Experience First**: Every feature begins with how it feels to use, not how it works internally.
- **Immediate Impact**: Users should be delighted from their first interaction with the welcome screen.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start minimal, layer in complexity only where it enhances the experience.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Development focuses on quick feedback loops and continuous refinement.

### Problem Statement
Developers juggle multiple tools (IDEs, terminals, AI chatbots), leading to context switching and productivity loss. Cortex solves this by:
- Providing a **unified terminal interface** for natural language and commands.
- Maintaining a **contextual memory** of decisions, code, and conversations.
- Acting as an **AI pair programmer** that understands project history.

### Key Features
- üñ•Ô∏è **Modern TUI**: Polished terminal interface with fluid animations and organic interactions.
- üß† **Associative Memory**: Recall past decisions using vector search and metadata.
- ‚ö° **LLM Orchestration**: Model-agnostic integration with OpenAI/OpenRouter/etc.
- üîí **Safety First**: Block dangerous commands unless explicitly allowed.
- üìä **Token Awareness**: Real-time tracking of LLM usage and limits.

### Design Principles
- **Minimal Yet Powerful**: Each feature serves a clear purpose with no unnecessary complexity.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important information stands out through subtle visual cues.
- **Responsive Flow**: Interface adapts smoothly to user actions and terminal constraints.
- **Contextual Awareness**: UI elements reflect system state and user intent.
- **Intuitive Interaction**: Commands and patterns follow natural developer workflows.

### Non-Features
- ‚ùå No terminal emulation (uses native shell environment)
- ‚ùå No file versioning (relies on Git/IDE)
- ‚ùå No sandboxed execution (runs in user's environment)

|                   | Subtle status indicators for system metrics (tokens/memory)                  |
|                   | Natural conversation flow with spatial navigation                            |
| **Memory Layer**  | Hybrid search (vector + tags), auto-archiving of old memories               |
| **LLM Integration**| Model-agnostic client with response streaming and token tracking           |
| **Safety**        | User-configurable allow/blocklist with confirmation for destructive commands |
| **Config**        | YAML/ENV configuration for API keys, themes, and default models             |

## Non-Functional Requirements
| Aspect            | Requirements                                                                 |
