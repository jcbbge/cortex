## Detailed Implementation Plan (MVP)

### 1. Graph Operations Integration
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Finalize Recursive Query Implementations  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1.1: Review and validate the recursive CTEs for `FindPaths`, `DetectCycles`, and `GetConnectedElements`.  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1.2: Ensure full test coverage (unit and integration) with passing tests.  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1.3: Optimize query performance for expected datasets.
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Integrate Graph Operations into the Core System  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2.1: Connect graph operations to the central command interface.  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2.2: Expose test hooks and logging for development debugging.  
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2.3: Prepare documentation for graph operations usage.

### 2. API and CLI Interface Development
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Develop RESTful Endpoints  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1.1: Define API contracts for core operations (graph queries, element creation, associations, etc.).  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1.2: Implement endpoint handlers with proper error handling and security.  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1.3: Write tests for each endpoint.
  
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Build a CLI Interface for Immediate Interaction  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2.1: Create commands for triggering graph operations (e.g., find paths, detect cycles).  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2.2: Integrate these commands with the existing terminal interface.  
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2.3: Provide user documentation/examples for using the CLI.

### 3. UI / TUI Enhancements (Terminal Interface)
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Refine the Terminal UI  
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1.1: Polish the design based on cues from [ai/overview.md] (fluid animations, clear status indicators).  
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1.2: Integrate context-aware messaging and feedback loops.  
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1.3: Conduct usability testing to validate improvements.

### 4. Performance Optimization and Database Improvements
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Optimize Database Performance  
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1.1: Analyze query execution plans for recursive queries.  
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1.2: Enhance index strategies and connection pooling.  
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1.3: Benchmark performance under load and iterate.
  
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Improve API and System Scalability  
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2.1: Evaluate batch operations and caching strategies.  
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2.2: Monitor real-time performance metrics for proactive tuning.

### 5. Data Validation and Security Hardening
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Strengthen Input and Schema Validation  
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1.1: Implement strict validation rules for incoming API data.  
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1.2: Enforce schema checks at the database and API layers.
  
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Enhance Security and Access Controls  
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2.1: Implement proper rate limiting and input sanitization.  
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2.2: Integrate API key and sensitive data management best practices.
