### Recent Progress
1. Identified need to switch from ltree to recursive queries for graph operations
2. Confirmed single PostgreSQL database approach for MVP
3. Decided to use production database for testing
4. Created initial test strategy focusing on breadth over depth
5. Established strict file management protocols

### Current State
1. Database Structure
   - Single PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Elements table contains vectors
   - Need to implement recursive graph queries
   - Testing using production database

2. Testing Framework
   - Basic test structure identified
   - Need to implement helper functions
   - Focus on essential operations
   - Using Go's built-in testing

3. Documentation
   - Worklog system in place
   - Strict append-only updates
   - Chronological ordering
   - Clear documentation standards

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement Test Framework
   - Create test helper functions
   - Basic CRUD test implementation
   - Association test implementation
   - Graph operation validation

2. Graph Operation Updates
   - Implement recursive queries
   - Add cycle detection
   - Create path finding functions
   - Performance monitoring

3. Documentation Needs
   - Document test procedures
   - Add implementation notes
   - Record performance baselines
   - Maintain development logs

### Critical Notes
1. File Management
   - ALL updates must be append-only
   - Never modify existing content
   - Add to bottom of files
   - Maintain chronological order

2. Testing Approach
   - Use production database
   - Focus on essential coverage
   - Test basic operations first
   - Document all test cases

3. Next Implementation Steps
   - Start with test helpers
   - Add basic CRUD tests
   - Implement graph operations
   - Add monitoring points

### Questions to Address
1. Performance metrics for graph operations?
2. Error handling strategy?
3. Test data volume requirements?
4. Backup procedures during testing?
