# Cortex Development Worklog

## 2024-01-31
### Session: Project Foundation and Database Setup

#### Completed
- Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector using official Docker image
- Successfully tested vector operations in database
- Created core project structure:
  - `/cmd/cortex` for main CLI
  - `/internal` for private application code
  - `/pkg` for shared packages
  - `/scripts` for utilities
- Added essential project files:
  - `go.mod` with initial dependencies
  - `Makefile` for build automation
  - `.golangci.yml` for linting configuration
  - `ci.yml` for GitHub Actions
  - `.gitignore` for Go projects

#### Decisions
- Using HNSW index for vector search based on scale/performance needs
- Single PostgreSQL instance for all storage needs (vectors, DAG, regular data)
- Following standard Go project layout conventions
- CI pipeline includes database service with pgvector

#### Technical Details
- PostgreSQL 15 with pgvector 0.8.0
- Go 1.21 as base version
- CGO enabled for vector extension compilation
- GitHub Actions with dockerized test database

#### Next Steps
- Implement Cobra CLI skeleton
- Set up Viper configuration management
- Create database interface layer
- Design initial schema for memory system

#### Notes
- Vector similarity search tested and working
- Docker setup simplified using official pgvector image
- Project structure ready for feature development

### Session: CLI Implementation

#### Completed
- Implemented basic Cobra CLI structure
- Created root command with configuration setup
- Added version command with build information
- Integrated Viper for configuration management
- Added hidden 'ping' command for testing
- Set up hot reload development environment with Air
- Added developer tooling commands to Makefile

#### Technical Details
- Using Cobra for CLI framework
- Viper configured to use:
  - Config file: `$HOME/.cortex.yaml`
  - Environment variables
  - Command line flags
- Version command shows:
  - Version number
  - Build time
  - Git commit hash
- Development environment:
  - Air for hot reloading
  - Make commands for common tasks
  - Automated tool installation

#### Next Steps
- Add interactive TUI command
- Implement configuration file generation
- Add database connection management
- Create initial CLI commands for memory operations

#### Notes
- Basic CLI skeleton is working
- Configuration system ready for expansion
- Development workflow optimized with hot reloading
- Project can now be built and run using `make dev`

### Session: Development Environment Optimization

#### Completed
- Successfully configured Air for hot reload development
- Fixed Air configuration file naming (.air.toml)
- Verified hot reload functionality with version command updates
- Tested development workflow with make commands

#### Technical Details
- Air v1.61.7 configured for Go development
- Hot reload watching all relevant project directories
- Makefile dev target using CGO_ENABLED=1
- Tested file watching and rebuild functionality

#### Next Steps
- Begin TUI implementation
- Set up database connection layer
- Design initial memory system schema

#### Notes
- Development workflow now streamlined with hot reload
- Build process working correctly with CGO enabled
- Project structure proven viable for rapid development

### Session: Revolutionary TUI Design Planning

#### Completed
- Redefined TUI requirements from split-pane to fluid, dynamic interface
- Conceptualized four major innovative interface components:
  - Fluid Context Visualization
  - Ambient Intelligence
  - Spatial Memory Navigation
  - Living Interface Elements
- Updated PRD to reflect new interface vision
- Added detailed technical milestones to roadmap
- Established performance targets (60fps, <16ms frame times)

#### Technical Decisions
- Moving away from traditional terminal UI patterns
- Focusing on organic, fluid interactions
- Prioritizing animation and transition smoothness
- Implementing context-aware visual feedback
- Using advanced Unicode/ASCII art for spatial representation

#### Research Areas Identified
- Terminal animation techniques and limitations
- Color theory for terminal displays
- ASCII/Unicode art generation
- Human-AI interaction patterns
- Spatial interface design

#### Next Steps
- Prototype basic animation framework
- Research terminal capability detection
- Begin frame timing system implementation
- Experiment with Unicode animation techniques

#### Notes
- Traditional split-pane layout rejected in favor of fluid design
- Performance metrics crucial for smooth experience
- Need to balance innovation with usability
- Potential for novel patents in CLI interaction design
- Focus on making AI collaboration feel natural and organic

#### Technical Challenges
- Terminal refresh rate limitations
- Color support variations across terminals
- Animation frame timing precision
- Memory efficiency for smooth transitions
- Unicode support across different platforms

#### Future Considerations
- Research needed on terminal capabilities:
  - iTerm2 vs standard terminal animation support
  - Color palette management across terminals
  - Unicode block drawing capabilities
  - Terminal resize event handling

- Key libraries to evaluate:
  - Bubble Tea for base TUI framework
  - Lip Gloss for styling
  - Termenv for terminal capability detection
  - Custom animation framework needs

- Proof of Concept Priorities:
  1. Basic animation frame timing system
  2. Simple particle effect demo
  3. Fluid text transitions
  4. Context visualization prototype

- Open Questions:
  - How to handle terminal window resizing during animations?
  - Best approach for frame buffering?
  - Strategy for graceful degradation in basic terminals?
  - Memory management for long-running animations?

#### Reference Materials
- iTerm2 proprietary escape sequences for advanced features
- Unicode blocks for "3D" effects: █▀▄▌▐░▒▓
- Terminal color support detection methods
- Relevant research papers on spatial interfaces
